## [project-1: Supply Chain Management Overview](https://github.com/Jagdish-Bhandari/Supply-Chain-Dynamic-Dashboard.git)
* 📊 Project Overview:
  
This dashboard is powered by two fact tables and five dimension tables. I performed data cleaning and structured the dataset using the Power Query Editor (ETL tool) to ensure a disciplined, analysis-ready format.

You’ll find region-wise, product-wise, state-wise, and country-wise sales performance visualized through interactive charts. A Combo Chart is used to compare Sales Value with Profit and Cost, leveraging dynamic measures and parameters for deeper insights.

The dashboard also includes DAX calculations that reveal customer purchase patterns, showcasing customer counts based on buying behavior. Interactive features such as bookmarks and slicers enhance navigation and user-driven exploration.

## [project-2: Work life Analysis Overview](https://github.com/Jagdish-Bhandari/Work_life_analysis.git)
#### ***A primary Data prespective***
* 📊 Project Overview:
This project is based on primary data analysis collected through a Google Form. The survey was distributed to working professionals across various industry domains to gain insights into their work-life balance. The form was thoughtfully structured into three key sections:

    1. Basic Information – capturing demographic and background details
    2. Job Satisfaction & Alignment – understanding how well individuals feel aligned with their roles and overall job satisfaction
    3. Educational Aspirations – exploring their interest in further studies and the barriers they may face.

**“In this Work-Life Analysis project, I developed two distinct Power BI dashboards to demonstrate different data integration approaches. The first dashboard is connected to a MySQL database, enabling structured data exploration. The second is directly linked to Google Form responses, allowing real-time updates as new inputs are submitted.
This dual setup ensures that insights remain current, dynamic, and reflective of the latest respondent feedback.
You can explore the full dashboard walkthrough and insights toward the end of this README.”** 

The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns in how career paths, satisfaction levels, and personal growth opportunities intersect in the modern workplace. Feel free to participate in the survey through the link below—it would be great to have your perspective.

* 📈 Data Analysis – KPIs
Key metrics identified to evaluate the work-life landscape:

  - Average Job Satisfaction Rating
  - Percentage of Respondents Feeling Safe/Respected at Work
  - Distribution of Annual Salary Ranges
  - Alignment of Jobs with Educational Background
  - Industry-wise Job Satisfaction Trends
  - Mental Health Impact Score Across Age Groups
  - Proportion Interested in Further Education vs Barriers Faced These KPIs helped surface high-level insights for deeper exploration.
