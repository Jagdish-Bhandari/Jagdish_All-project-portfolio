## [project-1: Supply Chain Management Overview](https://github.com/Jagdish-Bhandari/Supply-Chain-Dynamic-Dashboard.git)
* üìä Project Overview:
This dashboard is powered by two fact tables and five dimension tables. I performed data cleaning and structured the dataset using the Power Query Editor (ETL tool) to ensure a disciplined, analysis-ready format.

You‚Äôll find region-wise, product-wise, state-wise, and country-wise sales performance visualized through interactive charts. A Combo Chart is used to compare Sales Value with Profit and Cost, leveraging dynamic measures and parameters for deeper insights.

The dashboard also includes DAX calculations that reveal customer purchase patterns, showcasing customer counts based on buying behavior. Interactive features such as bookmarks and slicers enhance navigation and user-driven exploration.

#### ***A primary Data prespective***
* üìä Project Overview:
This project is based on primary data analysis collected through a Google Form. The survey was distributed to working professionals across various industry domains to gain insights into their work-life balance. The form was thoughtfully structured into three key sections:
